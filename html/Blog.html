            <h2>My Love for Taylor Swift</h2>
            <p>
              From the moment I heard "Love Story" on the radio, I knew there
              was something magical about Taylor Swift. Her lyrics feel like
              pages from my own diary â€” full of emotion, honesty, and
              storytelling that hits straight to the heart. ðŸŒŸ
              <br /><br />
              Taylorâ€™s journey from country to pop and now indie-folk shows how
              fearless and versatile she is as an artist. Whether Iâ€™m feeling on
              top of the world or just need to cry it out, thereâ€™s always a
              Taylor Swift song that understands me.
              <br /><br />
              Sheâ€™s not just a musician to me â€” sheâ€™s a role model, a comfort,
              and an inspiration.
              <br />
              Thank you, Taylor, for writing the soundtrack of my life.

            <h2>Projects I Built</h2>
            <p>
              <strong>Gamozo</strong> is a fun and simple web project I recently
              started to explore the world of front-end development. It's a
              small collection of classic games like <em>Tic Tac Toe</em>,
              <em>Stone Paper Scissors</em>, and more â€” built using only HTML,
              CSS, and a bit of JavaScript.
            </p>
            <p>
              The goal of this project is not just to play, but to learn. Every
              game I add is a way for me to practice logic, design, and
              interactivity.
              <br />
              Gamozo is my mini playground where fun meets code!

            <h2>Favorite YouTuber Shoutout</h2>
            <p>
              I love everything about the <strong>Haha Sisters</strong> â€” their
              stylish outfits, the fun bond they share, and the way they enjoy
              food together. Watching <strong>Erica</strong> eat is honestly a
              vibe! Her expressions make even the simplest meals look delicious.
            </p>
            <p>
              Whenever Iâ€™m stuck with a boring meal, I watch their videos â€” and
              suddenly, Iâ€™m enjoying every bite like Iâ€™m eating with them. I
              follow all three of them individually too.

            <h2>W3Schools</h2>
            <p>
              Whenever I get stuck while coding or just want to learn something
              new, <strong>W3Schools</strong> is my first stop. Itâ€™s super
              beginner-friendly, easy to understand, and filled with examples I
              can try right away.
            </p>
            <p>
              From HTML to JavaScript, itâ€™s helped me a lot in building this
              very project. If youâ€™re learning to code, I totally recommend
              checking it out!

            <h2>My Simple Tan-Removal Secret</h2>
            <p>
              Hey there! Just wanted to share something that really works for me
              when I feel tanned after a sunny day â€” a mix of
              <strong>turmeric, curd, and honey</strong>. Itâ€™s super simple and
              all natural!
            </p>
            <p>
              I just mix a little turmeric with fresh curd and a bit of honey,
              apply it to my face (or hands), and leave it on for 15 minutes.
              After washing it off, my skin feels so much softer and brighter.
              âœ¨ Give it a try sometime â€” your skin will thank you!

            <h2>My School</h2>
            <p>
              I love my school! Itâ€™s a place where I learn, laugh, and grow
              every day. The teachers are really kind and helpful â€” they make
              learning fun and easy to understand.
            </p>
            <p>
              The campus is always clean, peaceful, and surrounded by nature,
              which makes it feel calm and fresh. ðŸŒ¿
            </p>
            <p>
              But the best part? Iâ€™ve made some amazing friends here. We share
              memories, help each other, and have so much fun together. My
              school isnâ€™t just a place to study â€” itâ€™s where Iâ€™ve built a
              second home.
